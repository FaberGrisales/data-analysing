# Data Portfolio

This repository contains my data analysis and machine learning projects.

Each project starts as a Jupyter Notebook inside the `notebooks/` folder.  
As projects grow, they will include data, reusable code (`src/`), and reports.

Current projects:
- Customer Turnover (Churn) Analysis
